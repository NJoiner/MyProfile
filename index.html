<h2>Interesting fact about myself</h2>
<p>Currently I am living in a historical homestead called ‘Dromkeen’ that was built for Judge Author Wolfe Chomley in 1989,
	who acted as an assistant prosecutor for Ned Kelly case. Dromkeen Homestead in recent years has mostly been known as the hub for children’s literature within Australia,
with Various different Australian Authors Illustrators books and artwork on display. The original Dromkeen collection
and sculptures have since been donated to the Victoria State Library. Dromkeen now currently has Author/Illustrator Mark Wilsons new exhibition on display.

<h2>What are my Interests in IT?</h2>

<p>I love building and maintaining computers, and trying to keep up with the latest news about leading Technology from around the world.
From a young age I was always been quite fascinated with technology and how different devices can communicate and integrated with each other.
Sometimes I’ve looked at a particular device and thought well this would work well together if it had done this or this would work well if it was able to communicate to this.
Always looking for solutions to problems.</p>
<P>
Information Technology is particulary quite like Aviation in the aspect that there is quite a lot of problem solving, and that you have troubleshoot and learn how a particular system works in order
to find a solution.

<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>I choose to study RMIT to further my interests in IT and RMIT is one of the leading universities in Australia when it comes to Information Technology. Through RMIT I hope to expand my knowledge
	about IT and how it can be applied in different situation
and to advance in my pathway towards a career in IT.
