						<h3>What are my Interests in IT?</h3>

						<p>From an early age, I have always been fascinated with different forms of Technology.
							I have enjoyed building and maintaining computers, deconstructing and fixing various laptops and mobile phone devices around the house. I try to keep informed about the various
							technological inovations and news from around the world. I also have an interest in how different devices seamlessly interact with each other. I also look after the 'Dromkeen' website(using wordpress) and social media content.
						</p>
						<P>
						Information Technology is like Aviation in the from aspect that there is a lot of problem-solving is involved and that you have to troubleshot and understood how a particular system works to enable you to find a solution.

		<h2> Ideal Job</h2>
<p> I originally thought my ideal job would be designing/implementing technology solutions for businesses, in a role such as a “Technology Solutions Consultant”. But after doing some research, I believe I would be more suited for a sole such as a “Front End Web Developer”. </p>

	<h3>Personal Profile</h3>

	<p>I have included below  3 personality profile tests from 3 different sources</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Myers-Briggs</li>
	  <li>learning style test</li>
		<li>Big 5 personalty test</li>
	</ul>

		<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
		<p>After completing these three tests, I noticed that some of the results seem to contradict each other. When comparing the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test to the Big 5 test, the agreeableness/cooperation results do not match.
			However, In the the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test, I agree that I like to create a secure and stable environment for myself, that I am a cooperative, practical and grounded person and i do like to think realistically.
			I tend to visualise how a specific outcome may finish, and what could go wrong so that I can avoid it.
			It could also mean I have a slight tendency to avoid trying something new or being open to new experiences or exploring new environments.</p>
			<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
			When working in a group, I need to be open and receptivel to trying alternate options even if I think my solution is the practical option.</p>
