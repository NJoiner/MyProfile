							<h2>GroupProject Idea</h2>
	<p>The group project idea is to develop a mobile gaming application that targets the age demographic of 35 and over. The group will collectively choose what type of game they would like to create that is targeting this specific age group,
		 whether it is to create a casual puzzle game or make a visually appealing story-oriented RPG(role-playing game). The game needs to feel meaningful to the user and actively challenge the user.</p>

	<h2>Why this age demographic? Why mobile gaming?</h2>
	<p>According to MoPub, the average age for mobile gamers is 35 and over.</p>
	<p>According to DCI(Dot Com Infoway), in 2019, it was estimated that the global gaming market is worth over $152 billion. The global gaming market is expected to reach over $165.9 billion by 2020.[2]</p>
	<p>Mobile gaming sector also dominates the gaming market industry at 51%, followed by console 25% and PC games 24%. It is steadily increasing year after year, and as Smartphones are becoming more accessible to the general population around the world, creating new opportunities for more mobile gaming creators.</p>

	<h2>Game creation</h2>
<p>	Instead of locking the team into a particular game genre, I thought it would be interesting to allow the group to collectively choose what kind of game they would like to create.</p>
This group project would also include a specific variable target audience of the most popular age demographic.
	 The idea behind this is to encourage group participation from the start of the project.
	Some ideas for the type of game the group could make range from casual, adventure, action, card games, strategy, sports, trivia and word games.

	 <p>Currently, as of 2020 some of the more popular genres for mobile gaming include: [2]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>	Puzzles</li>
		<li>Arcade</li>
		<li>Action</li>
	<li>Racing</li>
		<li>Adventure</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Game Functions:</h2>
	<p>Gameplay for the user should feel highly interactive and meaningful, including something like a game progression systems, that contains levels or checkpoints, gear progression or equipment upgrades to create significant progress throughout the game.</p>
<p>	The user should feel that the user interface is highly intuitive and is easy to use. The gameplay should feel like it flows well from one scene to the next so that the user does not feel lost or confused at any point(not randomly jumping around back and forth between locations).</p>
<p>	Visually the game should make the user feel compelled to keep playing and retain the user's full attention completely throughout the use of the game. It could also include features like character customisation or vehicle modifications, so there are different forms of interaction
	throughout the game. The game background should suit the genre type of gameplay; it should feel evenly balanced, not overcluttered or oversimplified.</p>
<p>	The controls for this game should not feel overcomplicated so that if they were to pick up the game for the first time, they intuitively be able to understand how to play this game without the use of a manual. The game should include a variety of goals for the user to complete
	and to make them feel like they have accomplished something within this game(goal to work towards).</p>
	<p>The game should also consist of music/sound that is suitable for the game type, that the music does not clash with the game genre type eg.rock music in a casual adventure type game.</p>

	<h2>Free tools for mobile app development:</h2>
	<p>Depending on what kind of game the group wants to make(2D or 3D), there is a selection of different tools that are available to use to develop the mobile game app, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Corona SDK, Godot and Amazon Lumberyard.
	 The required HDD space would also be a limiting factor as Unreal Engine, for instance, takes up over 20GB of HHD space. Out of all these different programs, Unity seems to be the easiest one to learn</p>

	<h2>Skills Required</h2>
	<p>The group will be required to learn a "Native programming language" type from one of the previously stated gaming development applications.
	Learning another programming language could be quite daunting at this point, although the most common languages are C++, Objective-C, C#, Java, Lua.</p>
