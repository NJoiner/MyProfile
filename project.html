							<h3>Project Overview</h3>
						</header>
	<p>There is a generaly held perception that the gaming scene is mostly made up of a 'young male demographic'. However, according to Mopub [1]  “46% of all gaming enthusiast – mobile, console, PC and more are women”, and that the average age for mobile gamers is now 36.
The group project idea involves developing a game that is more suited to these findings.
The group will actively choose the type of game they would like to create.
</p>

	<h3>Why mobile gaming?</h3>
	<p>According to ‘CompareCamp’, the Mobile gaming sector accounts for 58% of the overall global gaming market. It is steadily increasing year after year, as Smartphones are becoming readily accessible to the general population around the world.
		This trend is providing new opportunities for more mobile gaming content creators. The gaming industry Is expected to reach $196 Billion by 2021 and of that the mobile gaming sector is expected to reach $165.9Billion.[2]</p>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>I thought it would be interesting to allow the group to brainstorm initially to decide as a group what type of game they would like to create. The idea behind this is to encourage group participation from the start of the project.
		As the game is developed each person could add a feature they would like to see within this game. This group project would also include a specific variable target audience of the most popular age demographic.</p>
	<p>	Some ideas for the type of game the group could make range from casual, adventure, action, card games, strategy, sports, trivia and word games.</p>

	 <p>Currently, as of 2020 some of the more popular genres for mobile gaming include: [2]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Puzzles</li>
		<li>Arcade</li>
		<li>Action</li>
		<li>Racing</li>
		<li>Adventure</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Game Functions:</h3>
	<p>The main key feature for this game, is that it allows the user to pick up right where they left off. Quite a lot of different puzzle games, card games, don't particulary allow the user to continue where they last finished.</p>
	<p>Gameplay for the user should feel highly interactive and meaningful, including something like a game progression systems, that contains levels or checkpoints, gear progression or equipment upgrades to create significant progress throughout the game.</p>
<p>	The user should feel that the user interface is highly intuitive and is easy to use. The gameplay should feel like it flows well from one scene to the next so that the user does not feel lost or confused at any point(not randomly jumping around back and forth between locations).</p>
<p>	Visually the game should make the user feel compelled to keep playing and retain the user's full attention completely throughout the use of the game. It could also include features like character customisation or vehicle modifications, so there are different forms of interaction
	throughout the game. The game background should suit the genre type of gameplay; it should feel evenly balanced, not overcluttered or oversimplified.</p>
<p>	The controls for this game should not feel overcomplicated so that if they were to pick up the game for the first time, they intuitively be able to understand how to play this game without the use of a manual. The game should include a variety of goals for the user to complete
	and to make them feel like they have accomplished something within this game(goal to work towards).</p>
	<p>The game should also consist of music/sound that is suitable for the game type, that the music does not clash with the game genre type eg.rock music in a casual adventure type game.</p>

	<h3>Free tools for mobile app development:</h3>
	<p>Depending on what kind of game the group wants to make(2D or 3D), there is a selection of different tools that are available to use to develop the mobile game app, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Corona SDK, Godot and Amazon Lumberyard.
	 The required HDD space would also be a limiting factor as Unreal Engine, for instance, takes up over 20GB of HHD space. Out of all these different programs, Unity seems to be the easiest one to learn</p>

	<h3>Skills Required</h3>
	<p>The group will be required to learn a "Native programming language" type from one of the previously stated gaming development applications.
	Learning another programming language could be quite daunting at this point, although the most common languages are C++, Objective-C, C#, Java, Lua.</p>

	<h3>Outcome:</h3>
<p>If successful, the game should be appealing to the age demographic of 35+
